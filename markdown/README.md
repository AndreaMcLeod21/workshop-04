## Emphasis

Bring your passion for numbers – whether in tables, code, or formulas – to tackling cutting edge challenges as you learn to create, manage, and understand data sets and functions. From _artificial intelligence to quantum physics_, you’ll be able to explore the practical and theoretical frameworks that guide all _technological innovations_, and perhaps even become part of the next great breakthrough.

## Strong

You’ll also graduate with **real-world career experience** and the beginnings of your **professional network** through our paid co-op streams, internships, capstone courses, and other hands-on opportunities.
